Propagation of peculiar perversions in programming

crokil
------

This was a language that I developed to teach myself flex/bison.
It has a dynamic syntax, vaguely inspired by assembly language.  It can evaluate mathematical expressions in pre-fix or in-fix notation.
Numbers can be stored in variables named a-z.
It also has support for function calls, where a function is assigned a number.

I'll document the syntax properly one day.  In the meantime, fibs.crokil is an example of how to print Fibonacci numbers.
